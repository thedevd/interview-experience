## Landis-Gyr (Role: Java Lead | Location: Noida | Date: 11th Jan 2020)

Landis-Gyr is a product based organization where I was interviewed for Java Development skills.

#### Level 1- Mutiplechoice based questions
It was a paper based mutiple choice question based on core java/hibernate/spring/RestFul webservices. There were total 30 questions and the timing was 30 minutes. (It was very easy)

#### Level 2- Technical Discussion
* Questions on project experience.
* Design a algorithm to remove other duplicate characters (considering case-sensitivity) from a String. (For ex if we have String input as - `Hi I am in Landis Gyr interview`, here we already encountered character `i` in word Hi so subsequent `i` will be removed.  The output should be `Hi I am n Lds Gyr tevw`.
* How to integrate Spring and hibernate in your application. (I was bit confused what did he mean as I said to him that I have configured them using Spring boot, but he was not convinced).
* Write a ManyToMany relationship in Hibernate and what is the logic of intermediate table, how this is managed in hibernate? Will you use which type of bag collection - List or Set and why?
* What is unidirectional and bidirectional relationship in hiberante, how do you create them in hibernate?
