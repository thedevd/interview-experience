The interviewer started the conversion with the his company's background and what the business they do and on which domain. Then he asked me go through my experience (prjects and technologies worked). Then he started the technical discussion with Java and Scala- 
* What do you mean java is platform independent and how? And how scala code is run inside the JVM?
* Is scala pure object oriented or pure functional programming?
* What is immutability, String is immutable so what is the advantage of making something Immutable?
* What is String Constant pool and why java has this? What happens when you create String? What is interning a String (String.intern())?
* What is final in java and Val in scala?
* How GC works in Java? What is small GC and full GC? What is young and old generations? What is eden and survivour space?
* What is Synchronization in java and Memory model semantic behind this?
* What do you mean by Checked/Unchecked Exception in java? Why Scala has no concept of Checked Exception?

This was basically a telephonic round (held around 45 minutes) and the conversation with the Interviewer was very healthy and friedly, but Freaknly speaking, I knew most of the answers but could not be able to explain them with confidence.
