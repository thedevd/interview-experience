## Ciena India Pvt. Ltd - (Role: Enterprise Software Engineer | Location: Pune | Date: 21 Jan 2020)
The whole interview process at Ciena took almost a month. During this time I went through 4 rounds (3 were from USA and last one was in-person in Pune office).

#### Level 1 (Technical + Managerial)
* This round was taken by two persons, both were from Ottawa, Canada. It happend in the EST timezone through Zoom video conferencing. 
* All the questions were based on the resume. I had read about the interview process of Ciena, so I was well prepared with my all past experience and current project. 
* This round involved random questions on the technologies I have worked such as Scala/Java/Distributed computing/AWS and some of them were related to managerial role like agile,scrum,customer handling scenarios.
* I would say, before the interview I was too nervous as this was first time for me to get interviewed by foreigners. But the way they made me comfirtable, I did not feel even single bit of nervousness in entire interview. The interview held for an hour.

#### Level 2 (Coding)
* This round was based on checking the coding especially data-structures and algorithm.
* This was again happened in the EST time zone, where I had been given two coding problems which I need to solve using any of the programming langauge. 
* Although the questions were looking too easy, but when I went further on this then I realized thier complexity. I remember one was to find the smallest positive missin number from an unsorted array where we can have negative numbers also.
* The timing to solve the problems was 120 minutes, but I took 3 hours to complete them. Although I had forgot to handle some edge cases, but atleast I was able to solve them till some extent. 
* I have been told to provide the solutions in github where I had to mention the steps to run the program. So here I had provided them a shipable kind of jar using maven with some unit testing using JUnit and assertion feature.

#### Level 3 (Techical + Managerial)
* This round was taken by the manager of the project. This was again happened in EST time zone through Zoom video conferencing.
* Frankly speaking, here I was again too nervous as the persom who was going to interview me had lot of technical background and he was holding Phd. degree in AI and machine learning at the age of 24. But when we started, I did not had any nervousness. Although for some time I had difficulty in grasping the accent but I was able to somehow understand :).
* This round was based on the resume and my past/current experience, where he tried to see my communication skills and the capability to absorb the pressure of some scenarios.

#### Level 4 (In-person)
* For this round I had to travel to thier Pune office. (The company had arranged the tickets and transport to reach Pune's office and return ticket.
* In this round, I was interviewed by a Senior person and Manager at Pune's office. The conversation was based on Java/testing.
